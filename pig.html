            <h1>Description</h1>
            <h2>Pig is a simple dice game typically played with a die. The objective of the game is to be the first
                player to reach a total of 100 points or more. On each turn, a player rolls the die and accumulates
                points based on the numbers rolled. The player can choose to continue rolling to accumulate more points,
                but if they roll a 1 on the die, their turn ends and they lose all the points they accumulated during
                that turn. Players can also choose to stop rolling and keep the points they have accumulated during that
                turn. The game continues until one player reaches the winning score of 100 or more points.</h2>
